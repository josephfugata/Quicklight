## About The Project

QUICKLIGHT is a Philippine-based company providing solar panel systems, street lights, and traffic solutions. The goal of this website is to serve as their primary digital storefront—educating visitors about the benefits of solar energy, showcasing their products and services, and generating leads through a free consultation form and an interactive savings calculator.

This project was built from the ground up to be not only visually appealing but also performant, accessible, and user-friendly.
